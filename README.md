This lab is sourced from and adapted from Professor Noli Brazil's course on <a href="https://cougrstats.wordpress.com/2018/10/12/webscraping-in-r/"> "Spatial Methods in Community Research" </a> and Manuel Giomond's <a href="https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/index.html"> "Intro to GIS and Spatial Analysis" </a> curriculum.

During class, we learned to process spatial data in R--particularly, areal/polygon data. This lab will talk more broadly about how to access and clean data from Open Data portals while also incorporating point data. The learning objectives are as follows:

1. Learn how to read in point data
2. Gain better understanding of Coordinate Reference Systems
3. Learn how to reproject spatial data
4. Learn how to bring in data from OpenStreetMap
5. Learn how to map point data
